# Cyberpunk Quote Machine

This is a React-Redux app that generates a quote from cyberpunk media. It was made as one of the projects for [freeCodeCamp's](https://freecodecamp.org) Front End Libraries unit.

Sass was used primarily for coding the CSS.

## React-Redux Things to Keep in Mind

- Redux reducers need you to return the state. This means you need a default state and if you're going to change the state, then replace it with a new state!
